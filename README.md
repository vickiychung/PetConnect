# PetConnect

PetConnect is a social media platform that allows pets to make new friends, and find old ones. Pet owners can see other pets that were adopted from the same shelter, are in the same zipcode or are the same species as thier pet. They can send connection requests to other pets and pet owners on the platform with the intention to find other cute pets to meet up with.
